# This script is an input filter for printcap printing on a unix machine. It
# uses the nprint program to print the file to the specified ncp-based 
# server and queue.
# For example you could have a printcap entry like this
#
# ncp:lp=/dev/null:sd=/usr/spool/ncp:sh:if=/usr/local/bin/ncpprint
#
# which would create a unix printer called "ncp" that will print via this 
# script. You will need to create the spool directory /usr/spool/ncp with
# appropriate permissions and ownerships for your system.

#
# Script further altered by hamiltom@ecnz.co.nz (Michael Hamilton)
# so that the server, service, and password can be read from 
# a /usr/var/spool/lpd/PRINTNAME/.config file.
#
# In order for this to work the /etc/printcap entry must include an 
# accounting file (af=...):
#
#   cdcolour:\
#	:cm=CD IBM Colorjet on 6th:\
#	:sd=/var/spool/lpd/cdcolour:\
#	:af=/var/spool/lpd/cdcolour/acct:\
#	:if=/usr/local/etc/ncpprint:\
#	:mx=0:\
#	:lp=/dev/null:
#
# The /usr/var/spool/lpd/PRINTNAME/.config file should contain:
#   server=PC_SERVER
#   queue=PRINTER_QUEUE
#   user="user"
#   password="password"
#
# Please, do not modify the order in the file.
# Example:
#   server=NWSERVER
#   queue=P_QUEUE1
#   user="fred"
#   password=""

#
# The last parameter to the filter is the accounting file name.
#   Extract the directory name from the file name.
#   Concat this with /.config to get the config file.
#
eval acct_file=\$$#
spool_dir=`dirname $acct_file` 
config_file=$spool_dir/.config

# Should read the following variables set in the config file:
#   server
#   queue
#   user
#   password

eval `cat $config_file`
