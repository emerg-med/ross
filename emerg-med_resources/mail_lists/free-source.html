  <h1>Ken's Musings about Free Software and Open Source</h1>

  <p>
  For the last few years, more and more of my work has involved using
  software that is freely available.  And to an increasing extent my
  work has been <b>on</b> such software (such as Apache, Jikes, CVS,
  Majordomo, and cvswe/cvswebedit).  There are two current
  major philosophies concerning the creation and use of such stuff,
  known as the <cite>free software</cite> and <cite>open source</cite>
  models.  Mostly these refer to how the software is licenced, but
  some of the issues deal with things like [re]distribution and
  modification.
  </p>
  <p>
  The emergence of the topic of freely-available source code onto the
  public landscape has either raised or refueled ideological arguments
  and discussions about almost all aspects, particularly nomenclature
  and usage/distribution permissions.
  </p>
  <p>
  As with almost everything with which I'm involved, I have opinions
  in this space.  On this page I'll blather about the two different
  viewpoints and conclude with my opinion -- complete with an explanation
  of why I take the position I do.
  </p>
  <p>
  My descriptions of the philosophies
  should <b>not</b> be regarded as authoritative; there is plenty
  of official documentation out there for both of them, so what's
  described here are nutshell definitions viewed through my eyes.
  </p>
  <p>
  Since most of the differences of opinion have to do with how
  software can be used, re-used, modified, and distributed,
  licencing is at the core of the matter.
  </p>

  <h2>Free Software</h2>
  <p>
  The word 'free' in English causes problems in this context, because
  a lot of people regard it as meaning they don't have to pay for
  the software.  That's not necessarily true, because the <i>intended</i>
  meaning of 'free' matches the French term <i>libre</i> -- or, as
  you may have heard it summarised, &quot;Free speech, not free beer.&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
  So what does <i>that</i> mean?  Well, it means that users of the software
  so categorised are free to modify it to suit their own needs -- which
  typically means the source code of the software must be available as
  well.
  </p>

  <h3>The Idea of Copyleft</h3>
  <p>
  One of the ideas to come out of the Free Software philosophy is
  that of <i>copyleft</i>.  This is a play on the term 'copyright,'
  which usually reserves most capabilities to the copyright holder and
  doles out some subset to others.  A copyleft, on the other hand, takes
  the opposite position, and forbids users of the software from
  imposing conditions on subsequent users that are <i>less</i> restrictive
  than the original licence.  In other words, if you received the
  sources as part of the software package, then you are not permitted
  to redistribute the package without including the sources as well.
  And you cannot relicence the software in any way that would permit
  subsequent users down the distribution change to do so, either.
  </p>

  <h3>GNU, the FSF, and the GPL</h3>
  <p>
  The ensign-carrier of the Free Software philosophy is the GNU
  Project.  (GNU is a reflexive acronym standing for &quot;GNU's not
  UNIX!&quot;)  The exact relationship between the GNU Project and the
  FSF (the Free Software Foundation) is unclear to me, so all I can
  reasonably say is that they're related somehow.
  </p>
  <p>
  The <i>GPL</i> is the GNU <i>General Public Licence</i>, and all software
  released as part of the GNU Project is licenced under either it
  or the <i>LGPL</i> (Lesser GPL), which primarily covers reusable
  packages such as libraries.  The GPL is an extremely popular copyleft
  licence with very wide-ranging implications.  If you use any fragment
  of GPLed software in another project, the result is covered by
  the GPL.  Even if you use a subroutine <i>in toto</i> from a
  GPLed source file, 
  </p>

  <h2>Open Source</h2>
  <p>
  &quot;Open source&quot; is a term coined relatively recently.  One
  of its <i>raisons d'&ecirc;tre</i> is to make the concept of
  source distribution more palatable to the commercial software
  sector; another is to distinguish a subset of free software that
  is <i>not</i> copylefted.
  </p>
  <p>
  The <i>Open Software Initiative</i> (OSI) is considered by
  many to be the keeper of the flame (and definition) for the
  'open-source' term as the GNU project and the FSF are the standard-bearers
  for the 'free software' idea.  The OSI has developed a document
  called the <i>Open Source Definition</i> (OSD) which is used
  to define whether a particular licence conforms to the requirements
  necessary to be considered Open Source.<a href="#en01"><sup>1</sup></a>
  </p>

  <h2>Multi-Licenced Software</h2>
  <p>
  The originator of any piece of software is always free to release
  (or re-release) it under whatever licence or combination of licences
  he or she pleases.  Some packages, such as MySQL and Aladdin's
  GhostScript, use variations on this theme to make the software
  available to individuals or non-profit organisations while
  requiring commercial ventures to purchase access to the software
  using a different licence.  The Aladdin case in particular
  is rather interesting, because it includes a time-based
  element:  If you want the latest and greatest version of an
  Aladdin software package, you need to pay money to purchase
  a licence for it.  However, all versions of their software
  is re-released under the GPL one year after the initial release.
  So the source becomes available, but people and organisations that
  want access to the latest features are required to pay for the privilege.
  </p>

  <h2>Where I Stand, and Why</h2>
  <p>
  I consider myself an open sourcerer; I won't work on (or release)
  software covered by the GPL or any other copyleft licence except in
  unusual circumstances.  I feel that the infective nature of copyleft
  licences does a disservice to the developer community and, more
  importantly, to the industry as a whole.
  </p>
  <p>
  Regardless of whether there are viable alternatives,
  a lot of commercial organisations are extremely reluctant to
  release the source code to their products, regarding the source
  as a trade secret.  And many copyleft licences include terms that
  prevent any part of software covered by them from being included
  as part of a package that is not itself completely source-available.
  </p>
  <p>
  This reluctance translates into non-participation in many open
  projects by companies that sell their software.  As a a consequence,
  they will not expose their customers to copylefted software,
  and thus an entire audience of potential users is missed.  Users
  of commercial software quite possibly have different intentions
  and needs than the traditional user of open software, and therefore
  it seems quite likely that those different needs will never be
  addressed by the open software -- because the developers aren't
  even aware of the audience, much less its needs and requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
  In addition, I feel quite strongly that the copyleft model can
  -- and does -- stifle innovation and deprive open projects of
  healthy competition.  If a person or organisation is free to
  take open software and make proprietary changes to it, and
  distribute/sell the result without making the source to the
  changes available, some open sourcerer is likely (and free) to
  reproduce the changes in the open project.<a href="#en02"><sup>2</sup></a>
  This allows the commercial sector to continue adding value
  to the product, and fuels the open project to re-engineer
  proprietary changes into the open version.  The result can
  be a sort of leap-frog effect, with the software and all three
  communities -- open developers, private developers, and end-users --
  benefiting.
  </p>
  <p>
  If such proprietary enhancements are forbidden, on the other hand,
  the only origin for innovation is the open sourcerers themselves.
  Once they and their [smaller] user base have done all they find
  interesting, there's a good chance the project may dwindle
  into moribundity, if not obscurity.  Competition feeds innovation
  and can add zest and interest.
  </p>
  <p>
  So I'm personally <i>not</i> in favour of copyleft licences like the GPL,
  and I <i>am</i> in favour of open-source licences such as BSD, Apache,
  and X.  I also tend to be in favour of dual licences that eventually
  lead to release of the source.

  <h3>End Notes</h3>
  <p class="endnote">
  <a name="en01"><sup>1</sup></a>
  The OSI attempted to register the term 'Open Source' as a trademark,
  which would permit them to control who was permitted to use it to
  describe software.  I don't recall if the application was rejected
  or if it was simply dropped, but use of the term is now essentially
  generic.  Organisations that care may be more specific and note
  that their licence(s) conform to the OSD rather than calling their
  software 'Open Source.'
  </p>
  <p class="endnote">
  <a name="en02"><sup>2</sup></a>
  If an enterprise patents a
  proprietary innovation and defends the patent, this positive
  effect can be negated.
