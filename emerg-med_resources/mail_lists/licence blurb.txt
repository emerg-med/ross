Unlike previous releases of GFS that were available under 
          the GNU General Public License, GFS 4.2 will be available only under 
          the terms of the newly created Sistina Public License. This license 
          is similar to the Aladdin Public License used for Ghostscript, a program 
          developed by L. Peter Deutsch to interpret PostScript documents. Like 
          Ghostscript, GFS was developed by a single entity (originally a research 
          group at the University of Minnesota and later by Sistina Software), 
          rather than a disparate community of free developers.
In addition, like Ghostscript, GFS is a technology that 
          has a clear OEM market. GFS has attracted OEM vendors who are embedding 
          the technology into their storage appliances and their commercial software 
          offerings. Under the GPL, these commercial vendors are less likely to 
          provide funding for GFS development and maintenance because of the free-rider 
          problem; competitors who don’t pay will directly benefit from those 
          who do. The Sistina Public License solves the free–rider problem 
          by creating a level playing field for all OEMs. The SPL provides Sistina 
          with a means to attain a sustainable revenue stream to continue to develop 
          and support GFS and other software.
Sistina is also currently certifying hardware to 
          be supplied by a network of qualified re-sellers. For this reason, it 
          is important that Sistina’s licensing policies enforce standards 
          for hardware certification, user support, and important customer service 
          issues.
